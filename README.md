<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Overview


RiderOvers is a dynamic and responsive bike rental system designed to provide users with a visually appealing and user-friendly experience. With an emphasis on detailed bike information, the platform caters to three main user roles: Customers, Hosts, and Admin. Customers can seamlessly rent bikes hosted by registered hosts after completing the mandatory KYC process. Hosts, in turn, register themselves and their bikes, gaining insights into their earnings and bookings through interactive charts. Admin, with comprehensive control, can view crucial details such as bike ownership, customer data, registered bikes, and bookings, utilizing a dedicated dashboard for insightful business analysis. The project also features social media integration and allows users and hosts to conveniently edit their profiles. RiderOvers is built using Python, Django, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript, promising a responsive and engaging bike rental experience.
